                    <span class="image left intern flex-item"><img src="images/IMG_0112.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                    <p class="flex-item">
                        In my spring 2022 APPL 412 class, Making Idea Into Reality, we were challenged to find a real
                        world problem and design and create a solution for that problem.
                        The problem that my team and I ended up finding was that for individuals with limited dexterity
                        zippers are challenging.
                        This problem was rather personal to our team because of family members who experience this issue
                        on a daily basis so we had first-hand testmimonies on the problems with zippers.
                        Although they seem like such an easy thing for adults zippers are require coordination in both
                        hands to link the two halves
                        together as well as a certain amount of force to pull the zipper upwards. Even a small amount of
                        dexterity loss can lead individuals not being able to use a zipper.
                        Dexterity loss in quite common in the population between old age as well as medical conditions
                        such as Parkinsons, cerebral palsy, and more.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <ul class="flex-container">
                    <li class="flex-item">
                        <p>
                            We started off with conducting interviews with individuals with dexterity issues to
                            understand what the problem was and exactly where they struggled when it came to zippers.
                            It turned out the answer was rather complex. For children it was more of a cognitive issue
                            in understanding the correct steps to get a zipper pulled up. For those with dexterity
                            issues it was that they couldn't use both arms or couldn't exert the force needed to hold
                            down the bottom of their jacket to get the zipper started.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the information we gathered we started brainstorming different ideas and created rough
                            prototypes until we discovered something that seemed like it would work. The idea was a
                            device that would clip to the bottom edge of a jacket. A user would then step on a portion
                            of the device and a retractable cord would pull the device tight and would keep one side of
                            the jacket taut while they used one arm to zip up their jacket.
