                    <p class="flex-item">
                        During my Falls 2022 COMP 523 class, Software Engineering Lab, we were tasked to create a
                        cross-platform mobile app for our client, the UNC Center for Nursing Excellence. Due to
                        everchanging policies, procedures, and resources for patient treatment they wanted something
                        that would give nurses timely updates.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <ul class="flex-container">
                    <li class="flex-item">
                        <p>
                            My team and I met with our client to see what kind of project they had in mind and it turned
                            out to be a mobile app. None my team members and I had much previous experience with mobile
                            apps and our client didn't know much about technology either so we consulted the UNC App Lab
                            to see what kind of technology might best fit out project. We had done some research and
                            thought a React Native app and a Firebase backend would be suitable and the App Lab agreed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After coming up with a UI design and having it approved by our client we began working on
                            the technical aspects. The project was split into two parts. The first was the React Native
                            mobile app which would be user facing and the second would be the React website that
                            administrators would use. These two sections of the project were split between our team and
                            I ended up working on the React Native mobile app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked to help construct the UI to make sure it looked like our UI mockups. In addition I
                            worked on connecting the Firebase backend to the mobile app.
                            A team member who had been working on the administrator website had already connected that
                            website to the backend but I had to make modifications to ensure that it would work with the
                            React Native mobile app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the course of the semester my team and I went from UI mockups to a fully functioning
                            mobile application. We presented our work to our client who were thrilled about the progress
                            that we had made.
