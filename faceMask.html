							<h1>Face Mask Effectiveness Simulation</h1>

							<p>
								During APPL 101: Exploring Engineering, I worked with a team of 2 other students to create a simulation that modeled the effectiveness of face masks.
								This was right at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and so we were interested in how effective different types of facemasks were at keeping out contagions.
								We conducted research on the production methods of the different facemask types and were able to create 
							</p>
							<p>
								Matlab was used to create this simulation where we compared N95 and cloth face masks.
								The face masks were simulated as a layer of inpenetrable material with holes in them that would allow particles to pass through.
								The difference between the two types of facemasks were the frequency of the holes.
								In our research, we found that N95 facemasks had less frequent and smaller holes than cloth would and so we modeled N95 as having less frequent holes.
								Air particles that move according to Brownian motion were generated on one side of the face masks and over time particles would diffuse over to the other side.
								We measured the number of particles that got through the face mask over time and graphed the results which you can see below.
								Just as we predicted, N95 masks did a better job of keeping particles out.
								However, it was interesting that over time, both masks eventually let the same amount of particles across. 
								This is due to diffusion and over time both masks would balance out regardless of how few holes they had.

							<h2>Ant Pathfinding Simulation Features</h2>
							<p class="flex-item"> Features include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Matlab simulation</li>
								<li>Brownian motion particles</li>
								<li>Graph how many particles penetrated over time</li>
								<li>Video of the particles moving over time</li>
							</ul>

							<p class="flex-item">
								From the beginning, our goal was to find out whether N95 or even a cloth mask would be sufficient to help you not get sick during the COVId-19 pandemic.
								Based on our simulation that had many simplifying assumptions, we determined that an N95 mask would be ideal.
								However, if an N95 mask is not avaiable to you, then a cloth mask would also be sufficient in keeping you safe.
								Having any mask at all is better than not having one.
								From this experience, I learned a great deal about how different types of masks are manufactured as well as how I would go about modeling the differences between the two types of masks.
